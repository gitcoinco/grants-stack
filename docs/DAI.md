# DAI in relation to Allo and Grants Stack

## Permit

- DAI has its own permit that is incompatible with EIP2612.
- It doesn't specify allowance, only `allowed: bool` (infinite approval or zero)
- Its version is always 0
- It's currently used on Ethereum and Polygon PoS
- DAI also supports EIP2612 permit on other chains.
- Some have version 1, some have version 2.
- Contracts that don't have a version method (as it's not part of the 2612 spec) are assumed to have version 1
- There's a difference between bridged DAI and Native DAI on some chains.
