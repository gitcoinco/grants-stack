The app structure ensures all components and services related to a particular feature are kept in a subdirectory of the `features` directory.

Observe the directory structure for Authentication feature in `features/auth`

```
├── features
│   ├── auth
│   │   ├── ProtectedRoute.tsx
│   │   ├── web3Service.tsx
```

It contains the `ProtectedRoute` component and `web3Service` which extends the base API service defined in `src/api.ts` by endpoint injection.
