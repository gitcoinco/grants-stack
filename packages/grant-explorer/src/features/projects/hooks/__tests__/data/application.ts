          'Mirror by Zaratan is a DAO platform for residential communities, being used successfully in a 9-person house, providing mechanisms for managing labor contributions, behavioral norms, and shared funds. Funding will go towards development, marketing, and legal costs for developing and distributing the tools to other communities.\n\nDAO platforms are an important but challenging vertical in the Web3 space. Seen as a type of "holy grail" for crypto, many projects have attempted to innovate in the space, and each provides valuable insights and lessons for others to learn from.\n\nMirror is a DAO platform specifically designed for residential communities wishing to operate in a decentralized fashion. It uses a Slack-based chat-bot interface to allow residents to engage in community governance and manage shared resources. The underlying technology involves innovative time-based mechanics, which can serve as a case study for other projects to learn from. So far, the mechanisms have been very effective, allowing a non-technical userbase to meaningfully engage in community governance.\n\nMirror was developed by game designers, economists, and crypto-economic engineers, and has been successfully deployed to a 9-person house in Los Angeles. The prototype implementation runs on a Web2 stack, with plans to target a Web3 backend on the horizon. The project was open-sourced under AGPL-3, with subscriptions to a managed service being used to support long-term development. This is a similar approach that projects such as Loomio, Ghost, and Proton have taken in the past.\n\nYou can read the Whitepaper here: https://bit.ly/mirror-whitepaper\n\nYou can learn more about Zaratan here: https://zaratan.world/\n\nTeam Members:\n\nDaniel Kronovet, project lead. Founder of Zaratan and developed the initial Mirror mechanisms; research engineer at Colony who helped developed the BudgetBox algorithm\n\nSeth Frey, research advisor. PhD Cognitive Science under Elinor Ostrom, helped develop the economic mechanisms\n\nJoseph DeSimone, research advisor. Game designer, helped develop the economic mechanisms',

            'Mirror by Zaratan is a DAO platform for residential communities, being used successfully in a 9-person house, providing mechanisms for managing labor contributions, behavioral norms, and shared funds. Funding will go towards development, marketing, and legal costs for developing and distributing the tools to other communities.\n\nDAO platforms are an important but challenging vertical in the Web3 space. Seen as a type of "holy grail" for crypto, many projects have attempted to innovate in the space, and each provides valuable insights and lessons for others to learn from.\n\nMirror is a DAO platform specifically designed for residential communities wishing to operate in a decentralized fashion. It uses a Slack-based chat-bot interface to allow residents to engage in community governance and manage shared resources. The underlying technology involves innovative time-based mechanics, which can serve as a case study for other projects to learn from. So far, the mechanisms have been very effective, allowing a non-technical userbase to meaningfully engage in community governance.\n\nMirror was developed by game designers, economists, and crypto-economic engineers, and has been successfully deployed to a 9-person house in Los Angeles. The prototype implementation runs on a Web2 stack, with plans to target a Web3 backend on the horizon. The project was open-sourced under AGPL-3, with subscriptions to a managed service being used to support long-term development. This is a similar approach that projects such as Loomio, Ghost, and Proton have taken in the past.\n\nYou can read the Whitepaper here: https://bit.ly/mirror-whitepaper\n\nYou can learn more about Zaratan here: https://zaratan.world/\n\nTeam Members:\n\nDaniel Kronovet, project lead. Founder of Zaratan and developed the initial Mirror mechanisms; research engineer at Colony who helped developed the BudgetBox algorithm\n\nSeth Frey, research advisor. PhD Cognitive Science under Elinor Ostrom, helped develop the economic mechanisms\n\nJoseph DeSimone, research advisor. Game designer, helped develop the economic mechanisms',
