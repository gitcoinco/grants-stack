# ERC20







*Implementation of the {IERC20} interface. This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}. For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}. TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How to implement supply mechanisms]. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn&#39;t required by the specification. Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance} functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.*

## Methods

### allowance

```solidity
function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256)
```



*See {IERC20-allowance}.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| owner | address | undefined |
| spender | address | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint256 | undefined |

### approve

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external nonpayable returns (bool)
```



*See {IERC20-approve}. NOTE: If `amount` is the maximum `uint256`, the allowance is not updated on `transferFrom`. This is semantically equivalent to an infinite approval. Requirements: - `spender` cannot be the zero address.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| spender | address | undefined |
| amount | uint256 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |

### balanceOf

```solidity
function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256)
```



*See {IERC20-balanceOf}.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| account | address | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint256 | undefined |

### decimals

```solidity
function decimals() external view returns (uint8)
```



*Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation. For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should be displayed to a user as `5.05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`). Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between Ether and Wei. This is the value {ERC20} uses, unless this function is overridden; NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including {IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint8 | undefined |

### decreaseAllowance

```solidity
function decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue) external nonpayable returns (bool)
```



*Atomically decreases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller. This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for problems described in {IERC20-approve}. Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance. Requirements: - `spender` cannot be the zero address. - `spender` must have allowance for the caller of at least `subtractedValue`.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| spender | address | undefined |
| subtractedValue | uint256 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |

### increaseAllowance

```solidity
function increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) external nonpayable returns (bool)
```



*Atomically increases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller. This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for problems described in {IERC20-approve}. Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance. Requirements: - `spender` cannot be the zero address.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| spender | address | undefined |
| addedValue | uint256 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |

### name

```solidity
function name() external view returns (string)
```



*Returns the name of the token.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | string | undefined |

### symbol

```solidity
function symbol() external view returns (string)
```



*Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the name.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | string | undefined |

### totalSupply

```solidity
function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256)
```



*See {IERC20-totalSupply}.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint256 | undefined |

### transfer

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external nonpayable returns (bool)
```



*See {IERC20-transfer}. Requirements: - `to` cannot be the zero address. - the caller must have a balance of at least `amount`.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| to | address | undefined |
| amount | uint256 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |

### transferFrom

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external nonpayable returns (bool)
```



*See {IERC20-transferFrom}. Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance. This is not required by the EIP. See the note at the beginning of {ERC20}. NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance is the maximum `uint256`. Requirements: - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address. - `from` must have a balance of at least `amount`. - the caller must have allowance for ``from``&#39;s tokens of at least `amount`.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| from | address | undefined |
| to | address | undefined |
| amount | uint256 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |



## Events

event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value)
```





#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| owner `indexed` | address | undefined |

### Transfer

```





#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
