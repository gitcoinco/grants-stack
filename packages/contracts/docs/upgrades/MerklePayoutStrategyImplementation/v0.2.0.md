- `BatchPayoutSuccessful` -  emitted on invoking `payout`

**New Struct**
- `Distribution` - structure of an individual distribution to be made

**New Functions**
- `updateDistribution` - implemented from IPayoutStrategy and ensure it can be invoked only if `isReadyForPayout` is not true. This was previous implemented in RoundImplementation.
- `hasBeenDistributed` - checks if Distribution has already been made
- `payout(bytes[] calldata _distributions)` -  not implemented due to issues wrt to encoding struct with dynamic data
- `payout` - implements batch distribution of funds via merkle proofs
- `_distribute` - private function which deals with paying out 1 distribution
- `_setDistributed` - private function which updates `distributedBitMap` to signal that a distribution is completed
