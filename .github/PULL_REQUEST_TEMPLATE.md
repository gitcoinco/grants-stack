## PR checklist

For every PR, make sure that these statements are true:
- [ ] Includes only changes relevant to the original ticket. Significant refactoring or formatting needs to be separated.
- [ ] Doesn't contain unnecessary type casts and non-null asserts
- [ ] Doesn't add `@ts-ignore`
- [ ] Doesn't disable lints, particularly `no-any` lints
- [ ] Doesn't use `useState` just for computation - use plain variables instead
- [ ] Splits components into pure components that don't depend on external state or hooks.
- [ ] Doesn't add components inside of components that depend on variables in the parent scope - separate them out
- [ ] Doesn't propagate optional values without good reason, doesn't mark property values as optional if that doesn't represent reality
- [ ] Doesn't duplicate existing code
- [ ] Parses out-of-domain data
- [ ] Does things as simple as possible, but not simpler.
- [ ] Doesn't reinvent the wheel or create premature abstractions.
- [ ] Doesn't contain commented out code.
- [ ] Doesn't contain skipped or empty tests.
