## PR checklist

For every PR, make sure that these statements are true:
- [ ] Includes only changes relevant to the original ticket. Significant refactoring needs to be separated.
- [ ] Doesn't contain type casts and non-null assertions.
- [ ] Doesn't add `@ts-ignore`.
- [ ] Doesn't disable lints.
- [ ] Doesn't use `useState` just for computation - use plain variables instead.
- [ ] Splits components into pure components that don't depend on external state or hooks.
- [ ] Avoid embedding components within other components
- [ ] Doesn't propagate optional values without good reason, doesn't mark property values as optional if that doesn't represent reality.
- [ ] Doesn't duplicate existing code.
- [ ] Parses out-of-domain data - this includes user input, API respones, on-chain data etc.
- [ ] Doesn't contain commented out code.
- [ ] Doesn't contain skipped or empty tests.

Subjective - at the discretion of the reviewers
- Does things as simply as possible, but not simpler.
- Doesn't reinvent the wheel or create premature abstractions.
