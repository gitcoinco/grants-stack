# Contributing to Round Manager and Grant Explorer

Thank you for your desire to contribute to Gitcoin! Below you will find some ways to help, but please don't feel limited
by them, and if you have any other ideas, pop by our [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/562828676480237578/1149808279871049880)

## Reporting issues

Before reporting an issue, please make sure to verify the following:

- You're running the latest version, including other components and systems the project might interact with
- Your dependencies are up-to-date

If the issue still persists, search the issue tracker. If there is an open ticket, please don't comment '+1' or
similar - use the 'üëç' emoji. Only comment if you have additional context, reproduction instructions or anything that
might help resolve the issue.

When opening a new issue, make sure it contains the following:

- Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- Screenshots or videos of the issue, if applicable
- Version information of the project
- Any other context that you feel would help resolve the issue

## Contributing code

We welcome all code contributions, large or small. Please see [DEV.md](docs/DEV.md) for
instructions on how to set up the project for development.

Before submitting a PR for review, please make sure that all the CI checks are passing.
We also utilize git hooks for pre-commit
formatting and pre-push checks, which should help you catch issues early, before they fail the CI.

We squash all PRs by default. When updating your PR branch, use merge if it's in review, or rebase otherwise, at your
own discretion.

_To keep the repository clean, we may mark PRs as stale if there has been no activity for more than a week, which are
then subject to closure and deletion. If you are stuck, feel free to reach out for help
in [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/562828676480237578/1149808279871049880)._
